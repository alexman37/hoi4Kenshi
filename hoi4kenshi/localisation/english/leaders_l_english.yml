 UNC_leader:0 "Emperor Tengu"
 UNC_leader_desc:0 "In a world where food, shelter, security, and freedom are fought and bled for, the smooth-skinned, short-statured scorchlander named Tengu has grown rather bored of them. And why should he feel guilty about it? Anyone, even a fucking peasant, could make it to the noble circle if they really wanted to. That’s what Lady Sanda did, and Lord Haga, and others before them. If his noble bloodline is so bad, why are people practically tripping over each other to kiss his feet on the streets? Why do the samurai continue to exist, serving with unquestioning loyalty to Tengu’s every command? No, it isn’t the nobles’ fault this world is in ruin. Tengu knows what the real problem is: everyone else. The Okranite zealots, those vile bandit gangs- and ESPECIALLY that fucking psychopath down South, Tinfist. They all have no endgame other than his downfall - the Empire’s downfall.\nAnd that’s why Lord Tengu doesn’t care if you hate him for his privileges, or his luxurious lifestyle- because frankly, he deserves it. In a world where everyone wants to burn society down, Tengu and his noble circle may well be the only thing keeping it together."
 
 HLN_leader:0 "Holy Lord Phoenix LXII"
 HLN_leader_desc:0 "No man is more powerful, feared, beloved, and despised than the great Holy Lord Phoenix, blessed be his name. Born for the 62nd time into a family of paupers he will never know, raised by the same High Paladins he commanded in his last life, every moment of this reincarnation’s being has been dedicated to the teachings of Okran, and nothing else. A rigorous military education molded the Phoenix into a strong leader and model Okranite. This time, he commands respect from his brothers not with speeches, but with physical prowess and fortitude. This Phoenix’s greatest skill is, undoubtedly, with the blade.\nHe is an ambitious conqueror, and a vicious fighter; driven by the blood of Narko’s servants purged by holy iron and flame. With monsters surrounding the Golden Plains on all sides, it seems that Okran could not have chosen a better time to bless the Holy Nation with a monster of their own."
 
 SHK_leader:0 "Esata The Stone Golem"
 SHK_leader_desc:0 "Like every great Shek warrior before her, The Stone Golem's road to glory was paved with the blood of countless Okranite and spider infestations. Unlike all the rest, though, Esata's most important battle was fought against one of her own kind.\nAs the Shek Kingdom faltered under Shager's disastrous world war, it was her lifelong friend, Bayan, who first saw the writing on the wall. No one would listen to a puny coward like him. No one, but for Esata. Only she heeded her intellectual ally's warnings of a cratering population and backwards technical advancement. Of all the finest, most brilliant warriors Shek leadership had to offer, only she could see Shager's way - the traditional Shek way - for what it was. Cultural suicide. And so it was. The loyal Esata, the mighty Stone Golem, challenged the brute Shager for the future of their people - and beat him at his own game.\nToday, Esata carefully leads the Shek Kingdom into a new age, with the wise Bayan at her side. In many ways, she is nothing like the self-destructive leaders of the past. But, like all Shek legends before her, she hopes to make her kin proud, and win the battle against their mortal foes.\nThis time, forever."

 SHN_leader:0 "High Inquisitor Seta"
 SHN_leader_desc:0 "High Inquisitor Seta is living proof that even gods can have a creator.\nAt just 22 years old, Seta had soared through the Holy Nation's military and religious ranks, earning himself the opportunity of a lifetime - the responsibility of training the young Phoenix into as skillful of a commander as him. From the moment his mentorship first began, Seta has guided the Phoenix with a firm, steady hand. He is the father that the Phoenix never had; perhaps the only man in the entire world who can tell a god what to do, and know that it shall be done. Seta knows he has moulded Okran's golden child into the perfect leader he is today. Not that he'll ever take responsibility for that - not that he ever needs to.\nOlder, slower, but still as sharp and charismatic as ever, Seta officially manages a smaller army holding Narko's fogmen at bay. But in reality, as it has always been, the Phoenix and Okran's children march down the dark tunnel that is this world - with Seta as their guiding light."
 
 IHN_leader:0 "High Inquisitor Vindictus"
 IHN_leader_desc:0 "Eight decades of unwavering, relentless faith to the blessed diety Okran has taught Vindicus one thing: there is far, far too much of Narko's degeneracy in this world.\nIf only, he laments, all people could simply accept Okran into their heart; so much destruction and suffering could be forever avoided. But Vindictus has long outgrown this naivety now. Some people are too tainted by Narko's beasts, too impure of heart, to listen to the good word of god willingly. And so it must be done by force. What kind of force? Vindictus has come to appreciate Okran's many forms of punishment. Reeducation for those that once spoke ill of Okran or his people, those who could still find salvation in this life. Rebirth for the beasts and witches of the world, who must wait until the next life for a chance at redemption. And for the worst heretics of all - their only remaining contribution is to become fuel in the ever-burning Holy flame.\nThe decrepit, dying general oversees it all, from his tower in Camp Rebirth. Narko's ever-growing list of traitors, spies, and demons, condemned to serve the one true god in Vindictus' pure, perfect little fiefdom."

 FLO_leader:0 "Moll"
 FLO_leader_desc:0 "“The Wicked Witch”, “The Black Death”, “The Whore of Narko”...Mallory has many nicknames, but she prefers the simple one. It’s far less pretentious. From her earliest days, all she’s ever done is fight the Holy Nation. First, the paladins tried to brainwash her, but they couldn’t answer her tough questions. Then they tried to control her, and were met with unwavering resilience every time. Now they’ve resorted to the much simpler method of just trying to kill her. Instead, one failed assassination after another has turned Moll into, perhaps, one of the most feared faces on the planet. No doubt, resistance has its cost- Moll tries not to think about what those bastards did to her innocent mother, and all the friends she’s lost to Rebirth or worse. But she can’t just give up. Never. Through and through, Moll has the heart of a rebel. Her fiery optimism, outstanding bravery, and faith in Okran - the REAL Okran - has helped her build the Flotsam Ninjas into the well-organized uprising they are today. And one day, Moll hopes, it will help her in freeing her sisters from the madness of the Phoenix’s unholy regime."

His life truly began when that sorry excuse of a tribe was wiped out, and he was personally taken in by a group of skeletons. These fantastic beings were nothing like humans - cruel, stupid, arrogant humans. Skeletons had thousands of years of knowledge and memories, possessed fascinating wisdom and insight into the mysteries of the world. But there was something else. Something troubling these skeletons, a terrible secret they simply could not share with even their favorite human. One by one, Savant could only watch in anguish as all his friends fell into insanity. Then he began to understand why. And Savant knew what must be done. Humans are the lucky ones…if only they could fully comprehend it, the joy of being flesh and bone.\n\nThe joy of being §Rhuman§!."
 
 SEM_leader:0 "Cat-Lon"
 SEM_leader_desc:0 "In an enormous withered husk on a cold, ashen plain, an ancient skeleton sits alone on his iron throne. White ash falls steadily through the cracks of the colossal, rotting structure, piling onto the mountains of rusted metal heads and CPU units. The skeleton remains still, as memories rush through his shattered mind. He remembers it all. When this whole world was once his kingdom. When this utterly devastated land, once his capitol, was a shining beacon of hope, renewal, and redemption. And how everything fell apart. The endless cycle of human violence. The betrayal of his own kind. And the staggering cost it took to make them see the light again. The mountains of corpses of friends, colleagues, brothers - no. He is a good sovereign. He vows to finish his mission, even if it never ends; and to never forget the memory of the lost souls, even if it costs him his own. In truth, King Cat-Lon died with his empire many, many centuries ago. This hollow shell of him has but one reason to remain on this long forgotten throne. In the tomb of the Second Empire, the mad king awaits his long-decided judgment, so that he, too, may finally crumble into the dust from which he came."

He, and his thousands of “children” who love him to death, will be the ones to fight back against the evil that has stolen so much from all of them. The ones who stole his precious daughter, Maggie. The United Cities: a corrupt circle of psychopathic nobles, driven by greed, power and bloodlust. A system which condemns its people to never ending poverty, servitude, and slavery! This rotten system, a society that enslaves its young, is a society with no future at all. Simion and his ragtag rebel army will make sure of that."
